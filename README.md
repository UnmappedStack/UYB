# The UYB Compiler Backend

UYB (abbreviation of `Up Your Backend`) is a from-scratch optimising compiler backend written in C, designed to be small and have fast compilation, while still being complete enough to be used for an actual compiler.

So far, it only compiles to an x86_64 Assembly target (GAS, AT&T).
