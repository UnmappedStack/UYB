# Contributing to UYB
Contributions to UYB are welcome! While this is primarily a one person project, that doesn't by any means limit it to *only* one person. However, there are some ground rules that are important to set:
 - Keep commit messages short.
 - Pull requests should explain what change was made, how it improves the project, and if the change was complex enough, it should link to documentation on the topic or explain how it works in a short overview.
 - Don't majorly restructure the project.
 - Open an [issue](https://github.com/UnmappedStack/UYB/issues/new) before starting work on a pull request and ask to be assigned to work on it. Similar rules apply here to writing a pull request description.
 - Most tiny contributions, such as changing a single character in a documentation file, which are clearly just for the sake of being added to the contributor list, will be ignored.

Now let's write a pretty nifty compiler backend!
